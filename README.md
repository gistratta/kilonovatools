# kilonovatools
tools useful for conversions from spectra to photometry, luminosity to fluxes and viceversa

== andNEDredshift.py  ==
adjusted from NED: used to compute distANCE LUMINOSITIES IN Mpc

#lumflux.pyd
several functions to ttransform between luminosity, flux desities and magnitudes

#ift.py  
used to integrate filter over model

#data2mod.py  
used to trasfrom data to model (e.g. an observed spectra )

#dosimphot.py  
used to simulate photmetry from models

# folder  trasm
transmission of sevral filters from hyperz ad svo (microns)
